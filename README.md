### Artist Portfolio Website
##### This website is an online image gallery for my personal visual artwork. I had a similar website for many years hosted through Squarespace using one of their premade layouts.
##### As I was teaching myself to program, it was a goal of mine to replace my old website with a new one that I built from scratch.
##### This project gave me experience with: 
##### - HTMl5
##### - CSS3
##### - JavaScript
##### - Bootstrap
##### - Responsive Web Design
##### - Flexbox
##### - Hosting through AWS
